# Pull Request Template

Including a table with commits and authors is nice (see (screenshot)[https://puu.sh/A4CaV/1181533388.png]).

Detail is nice too.

## Changelog or Summary of Changes

Tell us what you changed.

## Reasons for changes

Unecessary changes are unecessary and therefore unwanted.

Rewrites of current code to tidy it up are appreciated though.
