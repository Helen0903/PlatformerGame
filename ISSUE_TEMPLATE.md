# Issue Template

Before even considering submitting an issue report, search:

>Has this been said before?

>Has someone said they're working on it?

Do some research before you write an issue blindly.

## Initial Statement
Summarise what the issue is you've found.
Try to include pictures if applicable.

## Detail
Add detail later, including (but not limited to) a crash report, an error report, any kind of report, your hardware stats, etc.

Describe what you did to get the issue, and how to replicate it.

## Fixes
Do you know what caused the issue? Are you aware of how to fix it?

If you answer a *strong, bold, knowledgeble yes* to both then say. However if you are even the _tiniest_ bit unsure then don't. It's not helpful if you don't know what you're saying.
